# MetaCentrum User Documentation

This repository contains documentation for MetaCentrum grid services hosted at [docs.metacentrum.cz](https://docs.metacentrum.cz).

It uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate a static website. You can deploy it locally if you have Docker available on your system and execute `$ ./start.sh` in the root folder. After the build finishes the site will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
