# MetaCentrum User Documentation

This repository contains documentation for MetaCentrum grid services hosted at [docs.metacentrum.cz](https://docs.metacentrum.cz).

If you found an error or something is missing in this documentation please open an [issue](https://github.com/CESNET/metacentrum-user-docs/issues/new). Pull requests are also welcome.

The documentation pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown) and use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate a static website. You can deploy it locally if you have Docker available on your system and execute `$ ./start.sh` in the root folder. After the build finishes the site will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
