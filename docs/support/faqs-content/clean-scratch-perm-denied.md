# I get "permission denied" when I try to clean up scratch directory

The common confusion is that users try to remove the whole scratch directory

    rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR

while they are allowed to remove only the *content* of the scratch directory:

    rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR/*

The empty scratch directory will be removed automatically after some time.
