# What are Managed computing services, do I need a special login?

The so-called *Managed computing services* like [OnDemand](/software/ondemand), [Kubernetes](/services/kubernetes), [Galaxy](/services/galaxy) or [Jupyter notebboks](/services/jupyter) are just a subset of MetaCentrum services.

You need no specific login other than general MetaCentrum login to use these services.
