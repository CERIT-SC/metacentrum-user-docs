# What are Managed computing services, do I need a special login?

The so-called *Managed computing services* like [OnDemand](/software/ondemand), [Kubernetes](/related/kubernetes), [Galaxy](/related/galaxy) or [Jupyter notebboks](/software/sw-list/jupyter) are just a subset of MetaCentrum services.

You need no specific login other than general MetaCentrum login to use these services.
