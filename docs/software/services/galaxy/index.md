# Galaxy

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.cz/) is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational biomedical research. 

Metacentrum runs its own instance of Galaxy server. Proceed as described [in this tutorial on old user wiki](https://wiki.metacentrum.cz/wiki/Galaxy).

# UseGalaxy CZ

Metacentrum offers E-infra and Elixir members access to our [UseGalaxy CZ](https://usegalaxy.cz/) server. 

## Federated Login Options

Metacentrum Galaxy provides two convenient options for logging in:

1. **E-infra:** If you have an E-infra account you should use the designated option on the login page to access Metacentrum Galaxy.

2. **LifeScience:** If you are associated with the LifeScience/Elixir, you can log in using LifeScience AAI.

If you are a member of both institutions, you can link your identities in the Galaxy user settings:

- Go to your Galaxy user settings by clicking on **Preferences** in the **User** tab.
- Under **Preferences**, select **Manage Third-Party Identities**.
- Select the other identity provider and authenticate yourself.

This is recommended especially if you use the same e-mail in both institutions as you will not be able to access your Galaxy account via LifeScience AAI if you sign in with E-infra for the first time and vice versa. 
Overall it is a good idea to link your identities as you might end up in a situation where part of your research data exists on your LifeScience and part on your E-infra account.

## FTP Access

If you are a new user and wish to use FTP to upload files, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - When you first register on Metacentrum Galaxy, you won't have an FTP password by default.

2. **Reset Your Password:**

   - Enter your registered email address into the login panel.

3. **Reset Your Password via Email:**
   - Click on the "Click here to reset your password" button.

4. **Check Your Email:**
   - You will receive an email with a reset password link. Please check your email inbox, including your spam folder, if necessary.

5. **Set a New Password:**
   - Open the email and click on the provided link.
   - You will be directed to a page where you can set up a new password for your FTP access.

6. **FTP Access:**
   - Once you have set a new password, you can use your registered email address and the new password to log in via FTP.

Now, you can use your email address and password to upload files to Metacentrum Galaxy using your preferred FTP client.

## Data volatility reminder

Despite the relative safety of data storage on [UseGalaxy CZ](https://usegalaxy.cz/) server, we do not recommend any long-term data storage on the server as it is mainly designed for data processing and we cannot ensure the same level of data durability as provided by other storage solutions offered by Metacentrum.
