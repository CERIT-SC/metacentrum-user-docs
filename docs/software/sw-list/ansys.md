# Ansys

    module avail ansys/

[ANSYS](https://customercenter.ansys.com/) is a general nonlinear multiphysics software offering structural and thermodynamic analysis, continuum flow analysis, analysis of electrostatic and electromagnetic fields and acoustic analysis.

ANSYS can be run either from module or from a service.

## Usage

### OnDemand

ANSYS can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

### Kubernetes

Another option is to use [Kubernetes service](https://docs.cerit.io/), which offers [ANSYS application](https://docs.cerit.io/docs/ansys.html) as a Rancher application.

### Module 

Although this application can be used in text-only mode, in most use cases you will need graphical interface. We recommend to use [remote desktop](../../software/graphical-access). 

Running ANSYS from a module is recommended to advanced users or as a fallback option in case OnDemand and/or Kubernetes service cannot fulfill the user's requirements.

## Versions

!!! note
    Listed are only reasonably new version. Some older version are available, too, however we recommend their usage only in the case users need to reproduce some older computations.

## License

Ask scheduler for licence depending on purpose:

    add -l ansys-cfd=1     # 1 license of Ansys CFD
    add -l ansys-me=1      # 1 license of Ansys Mechanical
    add -l ansys-hpc=Z     # Z licenses of Ansys HPC

Check the number of currently available licenses

    module add ansys-2021-R1
    lmutil lmstat -c 1055@lm-brno.ics.muni.cz -a    # list all licences for all software

    # filter specific license feature "cfd_base"
    lmutil lmstat -c 1055@lm-brno.ics.muni.cz -a | grep cfd_base

or you can use Ansys specific license tool

    /software/ansys-2021/R1/v211/licensingclient/linx64/ansysli_util -statli 2325@lm-brno.ics.muni.cz -printavail

    # with filter to specific license feature "cfd_preppost":
    /software/ansys-2021/R1/v211/licensingclient/linx64/ansysli_util -statli 2325@lm-brno.ics.muni.cz -printavail | grep -B 3 -A 6 "FEATURENAME: cfd_preppost"

## Available ANSYS products

The following Ansys products are available within the MetaCentrum infrastructure:

- **Ansys CFD** - product combining two primary general-purpose fluids simulation products offered by ANSYS - **Ansys Fluent** and **Ansys CFX**.
    - **Ansys Fluent** contains the broad physical modeling capabilities needed to model flow, turbulence, heat transfer, and reactions for industrial applications.
    - **Ansys CFX** is a general purpose fluid dynamics program for simulating all types of models concerning fluid flow, including effects of temperature(conductance, radiance).
- **Ansys Mechanical** - product for simulating of structural and thermodynamic tasks. The engineering simulation product provides a complete set of elements behavior, material models and equation solvers for a wide range of mechanical design problems.

!!! note
    All ANSYS tools can utilize at **most 4 local CPUs** for task computation. For more demanding tasks in grid environment it's necessary to use additional tool â€“ **Ansys HPC**. Every ANSYS HPC license allows for distribution of computation to another available (local or remote) processor.

### Ansys Fluent

Ansys Fluent supports both interactive and batch use.

**Interactive usage**

For graphic environment, open the GUI interface.

For text-only regime login to a frontend and ask for interactive job in the standard way

```
ssh skirit.ics.muni.cz
qsub -I -l select=X:ncpus=Y:mem=Zgb  # text-only regime
```
Start Fluent and proceed according to onscreen instructions

```
module add ansys-18.2
fluent # graphic regime
fluent -g # text-only regime
```

**Batch usage**

Login to a frontend

Prepare input data and batch script -- in the script, use following commands:

a) for serial computation:

```
module add ansys-18.2
fluent <version> -g -i input_file  # serial initialization of Fluent
```

b) for paralel/distributed computation:

```
module add ansys-18.2
cpus=`cat $PBS_NODEFILE | wc -l`
fluent <version> -t${cpus} -p -cnf=$PBS_NODEFILE -g < flow.input  # parallel/distributed initialization of Fluent
```

Note: you can get list of available versions by running `$ fluent -v`.

Submit the batch script:

    skirit$ qsub -l select=X:ncpus=Y:mem=Zgb batch_script.sh

**Parallel batch usage**

It seems that best usage of parallel fluent differs from HW where fluent runs (infiniband vs. omnipath), as a rule of thumb you can use:

```
  if test $(sort -u < $PBS_NODEFILE |wc -l) -gt 1 -a -w /dev/hfi1_0;then  
          MPI_IMP=-mpi=intel
  fi
  fluent 2ddp -g -t$PBS_RESC_TOTAL_PROCS $MPI_IMP -cnf=$PBS_NODEFILE -i case.jou > case.out 2>&1
```

To utilize homogeneous cluster (fluent cannot optimally use nodes with different performance) , one should submit via:

   qsub -l select=N:...:infiniband=^none -l place=group=cluster ...

!!! tip
    To minimalize time needed for communication vith cortex component and increase performace, one can try to increase /solve/set/reporting-interval.

!!! tip
    Check the scalability of parallel run before spawning at dozens of processors, maybe the 16cpu run is faster then 32cpu one due to big communication overhead. 

### Ansys CFX

**Interactive usage**

For graphic environment, open the GUI interface. 

For text-only regime login to a frontend and ask for interactive job in the standard way

```
ssh skirit.ics.muni.cz
qsub -I -l select=X:ncpus=Y:mem=Zgb  # text-only regime
```
Start CFX and proceed according to onscreen instructions

```
cfx5 # graphical mode
cfx5launch # text-only mode
```

**Batch usage**

Login to a frontend

Prepare input data and batch script -- in the script, use following commands:
    
a) for serial computation:

```
module add ansys-18.2
cfx5pre -batch inputfile.pre [...]
cfx5solve -def inputfile [...]
cfdpost -batch inputfile.cse [...]
```
b) for paralel/distributed computation:

```
module add ansys-18.2

#### Create host list
hl=`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq -c | awk '{print $2"*"$1}' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//'`

#### Run the computation, e.g.
cfx5solve -def 0.def -ccl 0.ccl -part-large -start-method "Platform MPI Distributed Parallel" -par-dist $hl
```
Submit the batch script:

    skirit$ qsub -l select=X:ncpus=Y:mem=Zgb batch_script.sh

### Ansys Workbench

For graphic environment, open the GUI interface.

Start Workbench in the graphical mode

    runwb2 # graphical mode
