# Jupyter notebook

[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a project to develop open-source software, open standards, and services for interactive computing across multiple programming languages.

## Jupyter in OnDemand

Jupyter notebook can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

## Jupyter Hub/Lab in Kubernetes

Another option is to use [Kubernetes service -- see documentation](https://docs.cerit.io/en/web-apps/jupyterhub), which offers Jupyter notebook through [Jupyter hub](https://hub.cloud.e-infra.cz/hub/) or [Binder hub](https://bhub.cloud.e-infra.cz/hub/l).


## Jupyter notebook instance on cloud

Metacentrum run its own instance of Jupyter notebook servers on cloud. To use this option, proceed as described [in this tutorial](../../../related/jupyter).
